class Lasso(ElasticNet):
    """Linear Model trained with L1 prior as regularizer (aka the Lasso)

    The optimization objective for Lasso is::

        (1 / (2 * n_samples)) * ||y - Xw||^2_2 + alpha * ||w||_1

    Technically the Lasso model is optimizing the same objective function as
    the Elastic Net with ``l1_ratio=1.0`` (no L2 penalty).

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, optional
        Constant that multiplies the L1 term. Defaults to 1.0.
        ``alpha = 0`` is equivalent to an ordinary least square, solved
        by the :class:`LinearRegression` object. For numerical
        reasons, using ``alpha = 0`` is with the Lasso object is not advised
        and you should prefer the LinearRegression object.

    fit_intercept : boolean
        whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
        to false, no intercept will be used in calculations
        (e.g. data is expected to be already centered).

    normalize : boolean, optional, default False
        If ``True``, the regressors X will be normalized before regression.

    copy_X : boolean, optional, default True
        If ``True``, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.

    precompute : True | False | array-like
        Whether to use a precomputed Gram matrix to speed up
        calculations. The Gram matrix can also be passed as argument.

    max_iter : int, optional
        The maximum number of iterations

    tol : float, optional
        The tolerance for the optimization: if the updates are
        smaller than ``tol``, the optimization code checks the
        dual gap for optimality and continues until it is smaller
        than ``tol``.

    warm_start : bool, optional
        When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as
        initialization, otherwise, just erase the previous solution.

    positive : bool, optional
        When set to ``True``, forces the coefficients to be positive.

    selection : str, default 'cyclic'
        If set to 'random', a random coefficient is updated every iteration
        rather than looping over features sequentially by default. This
        (setting to 'random') often leads to significantly faster convergence
        especially when tol is higher than 1e-4.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance, or None (default)
        The seed of the pseudo random number generator that selects
        a random feature to update. Useful only when selection is set to
        'random'.

    Attributes
    ----------
    coef_ : array, shape = (n_features,)
        parameter vector (w in the cost function formula)

    intercept_ : float
        independent term in decision function.

    n_iter_ : int
        number of iterations run by the coordinate descent solver to reach
        the specified tolerance.
